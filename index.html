    <h1>Privacy Policy for Spoofy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 15, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Spoofy ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our app handles information when you use our call screening service.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our app collects and stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone numbers</strong> of incoming calls that are screened</li>
        <li><strong>Timestamps</strong> of when calls were received</li>
        <li><strong>Call status</strong> (whether calls were blocked or allowed)</li>
        <li><strong>Area code preferences</strong> that you configure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Screen incoming calls based on your configured area code settings</li>
        <li>Display your call history within the app</li>
        <li>Allow you to review which calls were blocked or allowed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All data is stored exclusively on your device using Android's SharedPreferences. We do not transmit, upload, or store your data on any external servers or cloud services.</p>
    <p><strong>No Third-Party Access:</strong> Your call data is never shared with, sold to, or accessed by any third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>No Analytics or Tracking:</strong> We do not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising services that would collect your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Call history is retained on your device until you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manually clear the app's data through Android settings</li>
        <li>Uninstall the application</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app automatically limits call history to the most recent 100 records.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> View all stored call records in the app's Call Log section</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Clear all data by going to Settings → Apps → Call Blocker → Storage → Clear Data</li>
        <li><strong>Configure:</strong> Change area code settings at any time in the app's Settings section</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our app requires the following Android permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Call Screening Role:</strong> Required to intercept and screen incoming calls</li>
        <li><strong>Phone State:</strong> Required to access call information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used exclusively for the core functionality of blocking unwanted calls.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app does not integrate with or use any third-party services, SDKs, or APIs that would collect or process your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Breach Notification</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to external servers, the risk of a data breach from our side is non-existent. Your data security depends on your device's security measures.</p>
